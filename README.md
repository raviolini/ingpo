# ingpo.io
An information sharing platform.

## Concept
### Motivation
Some teachers post their assignments on our _LMS_ website, while others post them on _Google Classroom_ or do not post them at all. This can cause confusion most of the time, especially when there are times when lessons are marked as assignments with due dates and etc. This can drain students' time and productivity.
### Solution
This app aims to solve those confusions by giving students a platform to share information, track information's liability, and review or edit unclear or misleading information.
